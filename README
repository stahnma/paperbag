Paperbag is designed to be a really basic testing framework for puppet on various platforms.  The idea for me was simply that I had multiple platforms to manage and not every resource type worked properly on each platform.  

Ideally this would be a complete and comprehensive test of each resource type and all parameters, however, one must crawl before one walks. 

Currently this runs extremely simple manifests and then validates the results of the manifests using test/unit ruby scripts.  Eventually I will add the hooks toe have this plug into a Hudson CI server via an external job monitor.

I am sure there are bugs and features missing.  If you want to help, open issues on github, or fork and improve the code. 

The name paperbag was chosen because the simplest form of a puppet I could thin of was a lunch-sized paper bag.  I figured this was doing really simple things with puppet, so I named it paperbag.
